# Text_generation

In this repository, we will talk about text generation. 
     Text genration is basically genration a text in some style. Like the common example is generating a text like shakesphere would have written it. By using text generation, we can build various types of texts like official letters, music albums or similar things that usually take a lot of time. Now, NLP is in no way perfect right now and its a maturing field. So, what we will do is to generate the text as best as we can and then refining the text manually so that we can have somethign credible in the end. 
     This project is like an experiment and we will try to build various types of texts and see in what field we can apply our method and in what it will give poor results? Hopefully, in the end , we will have some mindset on where to use it.
     So, with this lets start our project.
     
We will be using transfer learning for the task 'cause it would be easier and more accurate. I have just finished fast.ai course by Jeremy Howard(which is great by the way) and so wanted to use fastai in a project. So, some of the code will be taken from one of the lecture from the course.
